# Codex

Codex is a collection of data science tools written in python and pet project notebooks.

## Style

Follow PEP 8 guidelines. [`autopep8`](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) is used to standardize the code.

Run [`pylint`](https://www.pylint.org/) on the codebase to enforce coding standards and check for code smells.

## Running the tests

The [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) framework is used to run tests.
